# Food, Mood, Good Dude

    This project solves the age old question, "What am I going to eat?". By answering one question and either inputing your zip code or turning your location on this app is able to tell you your current mood, what food you should eat and the restaurants closest to you that serve that.

# Motivation

    We live in a microwave society, and we are used to having things instant without thought. This project exists to take away the thinking portion of what you are going to eat. We were tasked at creating something awesome, and we wanted to go in a direction that was out of the typical norm.
